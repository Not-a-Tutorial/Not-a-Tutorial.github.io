          <h2>to Share a Few Hobbies</h2>
          <p>Plenty of websites let people share things about themselves, but I decided to go solo. The site is also going to be a test of my ability to do front-end web design again. I was inspired by a lot of the personal web folks on YouTube; thanks to those creators for helping me take the plung.</p>
          <p>So, let me share a few things that I like to do. Navigation at the top of the page should take you to posts on some of my interests.</p>
