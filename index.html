            <h3>Update 2 - Sept. 9, 2024</h3>
            <p>Having worked with some <mark>CSS</mark> on freecodecamp.org, I think we'll try make this page look like a notebook, giving the page a slight blue hue, blue horizontal lines, red left margin line, and maybe some fun yellow adhesive notes. This will be an interesting challenge. As well, the first <mark>HTML</mark> project was to make a form. I will adapt that to make a form for a guest book. Both will be interesting projects. I didn't know that these languages had so many unique functions, like linear gradients and blurs. Previously, I thought those effects on pages were limited to embedded images.</p>
            <p>Creating this visual style will be an interesting challenge; excited to give it a try.</p>
