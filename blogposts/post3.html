           <h1>Experiments in Skylines</h1>
           <h2>Sept. 4, 2024</h2>

              <p>This will be a photography post about photography with no photos (for now). I like to travel light when vacationing. My photgraphy bag has around 5 lenses, a flash, and multiple filters. That just won't do. So, before leaving, I usually pack my camera with a single lens. The nifty-fifty usually does the job for most things, so I left for Philly with just that on my full-frame DSLR.</p>
              <p>It had been a few years since I'd been in a city, walking the sidewalks, weaving between skyscrapers. I found myself wanting to take shots of the skyline as seen from the pavement, but the thin streets of the pre-revolutionary city caused cramped angles of monolithic structures ominously overlooking smaller historic buildings.</p>
              <p>At first, I was disappointed by the somewhat cramped views I had through my lens. The field of view unable to fully capture the megalithic structures. But, as I looked up, I was drawn in by the layers of infrastructure. Brick gave way to concrete gave way to glass and eventually sky. The shear weight of the city beared down on me, the framing of the photos gasped for air begging for sky through the towers man had made.</p>
              <p>All in all, pretty neat.</p>
